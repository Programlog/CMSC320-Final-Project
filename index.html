    </header>

    <section class="section" id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My project delves into Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data, offering a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of its performance over time. My goal is to uncover key insights into stock price behaviors, correlations, and market trends, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques. These findings are designed to help readers to make better informed decisions, not just about Apple stock, but also about other stocks with similar characteristics, such as Amazon and other tech giants.<p>
    <p>
        At the heart of this analysis are two key research questions among others:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            How do key metrics such as opening price, closing price, and trading volume correlate with each other, and what do these correlations reveal about Apple’s stock behavior over time?
        </li>
        <li>
            Can machine learning models like LSTMs accurately predict Apple’s stock price based on historical data? If so, what are the limitations of such models in capturing stock price variance?
        </li>
    </ul>


<p>Whether you're a beginner in investing or have more experience, my aim is to make complex stock data approachable and actionable. As a relatively new investor myself, I understand how daunting the stock market can seem. Breaking it down piece by piece can truly make a difference. By combining data exploration, statistical analysis, and machine learning, I hope to not only present some important trends in Apple’s stock but also inspire you to be comfortable to using technology and modern tools to help you invest with greater confidence! </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="data-curation">
        <h2>Data Curation</h2>
        <p>The data for this analysis was sourced from publicly available historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) on Kaggle Apple Stock Price from 1980-2021 by Meet Nagadia. 
            The dataset is verified and comprehensive, with records over 40 years of extensive data, allowing for robust trend analysis over 
            different economic cycles and major market events. This depth of historical data helps to ensure that our conclusions 
            and predictions are grounded in significant evidence and not influenced by short term noise.</p>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/apple-stock-price-from-19802021/data/">Kaggle Dataset</a>
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17E3oGQ1A15vTnINKlFuGnCHRhbGoPjjN?usp=sharing"> Colab Notebook</a>
        <h3>Imports</h3>
        <pre><code>import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM</code></pre>
<p><strong>Loading and Preprocessing Data</strong><p>
<pre><code>df = pd.read_csv('AAPL.csv')</code></pre>
<p>Load the dataset downloaded from Kaggle into a Pandas dataframe</p>
        <p>Next preprocessing steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Converting Dates:</strong> Dates were converted to standard datetime objects to enable effective analysis and ensure accurate plotting and resampling.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring Data Integrity:</strong> We checked for and handled missing values, ensuring no gaps in the data. Data quality is crucial for the reliability of any analysis, and missing values could lead to inaccurate insights.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
print(df.isnull().sum())  # all zeroes, no missing values!</code></pre>
<p>We are also going to need a new column for the change in stock price day by day known as Daily Return, which will be very useful for seeing the growth prospects of Apple. This can be derived by taking a rolling difference of Adj Close price.</p>
        <pre><code>df['Daily Return'] = df['Adj Close'].pct_change() #% diff adj close (previous row and current row by default) </code></pre>

    </section>

   <section class="section" id="analysis">
    <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>

    <h3>Graphical Analysis</h3>
<p>Plot distribution of Adjusted Close Prices, an important statistic.
<pre><code>plt.hist(df['Adj Close'], bins=50, edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Adjusted Close Prices')
plt.xlabel('Adjusted Close Price')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()</code></pre>
<img src="adjclose.png" alt="adj close price graph">
<p>        This histogram shows the distribution of Apple’s adjusted close prices over time. Most of the stock prices are 
        concentrated in the lower range between $0 and $25, with the frequency dropping off as prices increase. 
        This indicates that Apple’s stock price was much lower for most of the dataset's time period, with only a few occurrences 
        of higher prices. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The skewed nature of the distribution suggests a historical growth pattern where the stock started at lower prices 
        and gradually increased over time. This graph highlights Apple’s trajectory as a growth stock, confirming its significant price appreciation over the years. Factors such as Apple’s stock splits and adjustments for dividends contribute to 
        the clustering of lower prices, as these events reduce the stock price but don't change the overall value of Apple.
        For long term investors, this visualization underscores the value of early investments in Apple, showcasing how much the stock has grown over its history and how recently it rose to current heights.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Correlations Between Stock Metrics</strong></p>
<pre><code>corr = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', 'Volume']].corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Stock features')
plt.show()</code></pre>
            <img src="image3.png" alt="correlations between stock metrics as heatmap" width="400" height="350">
 <p>This heatmap shows the correlations between key stock metrics (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), providing an intuitive visual representation of how these variables move in relation to one another. For instance, high correlations between opening and closing prices provide evidence of the intraday trend consistency. This consistency can be expected, given that stocks tend to exhibit similar behavior throughout a single trading day, driven by broader market sentiment and investor behavior.</p> <p>On the other hand, trading volume exhibits a weak negative correlation (shown in blue) with these price metrics, indicating that price movements are not strongly influenced by trading volume, though a slight inverse relationship may exist. This suggests that while volume can spike during major market events, it is not a reliable predictor of price changes on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Time series graph of daily returns and outliers</strong></p>
<pre><code>daily_return_cleaned = df['Daily Return'].dropna().reset_index(drop=True)
z_scores = stats.zscore(daily_return_cleaned)

outliers = daily_return_cleaned[abs(z_scores) > 3] # data points with a z score greater than +- 3 can be considered outlier

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(df['Date'][1:].reset_index(drop=True), daily_return_cleaned, label='Daily Returns')
plt.scatter(df['Date'][1:].reset_index(drop=True)[abs(z_scores) > 3], outliers, color='red', label='Outliers')
plt.title('Daily Returns with Outliers Highlighted')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Daily Return')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

len(outliers) / len(daily_return_cleaned) # 0.012611 approx 1.26%</code></pre>
            <img src="image2.png" alt="daily returns" width="500" height="325">

<p> This time series plot of Apple’s daily stock returns, with significant outliers (discovered with z-score) marked in red. These outliers represent extreme deviations from the norm, often associated with major market events such as the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the 2008 financial crisis, and recently the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The majority of daily returns cluster around zero, demonstrating the relative stability of Apple’s stock over time. Observing the peaks and valleys in daily returns can help identify both opportunities for buying low and selling high. These are great opportunities to make money, but its also easy to lose money. Understanding these outliers can help you as investors anticipate potential risks and opportunities tied to economic news or company specific news.</p>
<p>Note: the outliers make up a small part of the overall dataset, 1.26%. This indicates, days of dramatic price returns in AAPL are pretty rare and only happen once every 80 days, on averages.</p>

    <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Statistical Test on Daily Returns:</strong>  
        We conducted a one sided one sample t-test to determine whether the mean daily return is significantly greater than zero. This analysis helps assess whether, over time, 
        the stock's returns tend to be consistently positive or negative, a fundamental indicator for long-term investors.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Hypotheses:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>H<sub>0</sub>:</strong> μ = 0 (Mean daily return is equal to zero.)</li>
        <li><strong>H<sub>a</sub>:</strong> μ > 0 (Mean daily return is not equal to zero.)</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code>_, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(df['Daily Return'].dropna(), 0, alternative='greater')
p_value # 3.90e-05 < .05, reject H0</code></pre>

    <p>The results showed that the p-value was less than a typical alpha value of 0.05, we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the mean daily return is equal to 0). Specifically, the positive returns suggest that Apple stockholders, on average, experience a profit each day. This means there is a statistically significant positive average daily return for Apple's stock from 1980 to 2021. In simpler terms, the stock has tended to go up in value on average during this periods.</p>
<p>While this is statistically significant, it's important to consider the practical significance as well. A small positive daily return, even if statistically significant, might not be very meaningful in practical terms for an investor, especially considering headwinds like risk and transaction costs. But in this case, as the stock is up tens of thousands of percent since 1980, there is probably some practical significance to the small positive daily return.    </p>
<p>Overall, this evidence provides a level of confidence to investors that the observed trend is not due to random chance but rather a consistent pattern. Although small, the positive average daily return contributes to positive expected returns over the years. So investors can reasonably anticipate that their investment in AAPL has the potential to grow over the long run but they should be know 'past performance is not a guarantee of future returns'.

    <section class="section" id="machine learning analysis">
        <h2>Primary analysis</h2>
<p>In this section, I explore how machine learning can be used to predict Apple’s stock prices. I used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is great for working with time series data like stock prices because it can identify patterns in sequences. The idea was to see if we could use Apple’s stock price data to make accurate predictions about its future performance. While the results are promising and show the power of machine learning, there are some important limitations to keep in mind after, stock prices are influenced by so many unpredictable factors that it's nearly impossible for any one model to take all of them into account. I'll show what is possible with machine learning in a a fast moving and complex market like this one, and how you can use it on your investing journey.</p>
        <body>
            <h3>1. Data Preparation</h1>
            <p>The adjusted closing price, which is the target variable for our prediction.</p>
            <pre><code>adj_close = df[['Adj Close']]</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Preprocessing Data:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(adj_close)</code></pre>
            <p>The fit_transform method is used to fit the scaler to the adj_close data and then transform it to the scaled values.</p>
            <pre><code>train_data_len = int(np.ceil(len(scaled_data) * 0.8))
                train_data = scaled_data[0:train_data_len, :] </code></pre>
            <p>Calculates and selects the first 80% of the scaled data (adj. close) for training.</p>
            <h3>2. Creating Training Data</h2>
            <pre><code>X_train = []
y_train = []</code></pre>
            <p><strong>X_train, y_train</strong> lists will store the input features and target values for the training data, respectively.</p>
            <pre><code>for i in range(60, len(train_data)):
        X_train.append(train_data[i-60:i, 0])
        y_train.append(train_data[i, 0])</code></pre>
            <p>The for loop iterates through the training data, creating data points for the model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X_train</strong> holds the previous 60 days adjusted closing prices, essentially using a 60 day window as input to the LSTM model.</li>
                <li><strong>y_train</strong> holds the adjusted closing price of the current day, which is the value the model will try to predict.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>X_train, y_train = np.array(X_train), np.array(y_train)
X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>X_train</code> and <code>y_train</code> lists are then converted into NumPy arrays. <code>X_train</code> is reshaped to a 3D array because it will be fed into the LSTM model (samples, timesteps, features).</p>
            <h3>3. Building and Training the Model</h2>
            <pre><code>model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(units=25))
model.add(Dense(units=1))</code></pre>
            <p>Here, we create a keras model and add two LSTM layers to the model, with 50 units each. I chose LSTMs here because they work well with sequential data like time series such as this one.</p>
            <pre><code>model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')</code></pre>
            <p>Make the model for training using the very popular and versatile Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function we learned in class.</p>
            <pre><code>model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=5, epochs=25)</code></pre>
            <p>Trains the model on the training data (<code>X_train</code>, <code>y_train</code>) for 25 epochs. I chose to train over 25 epochs because I noticed the training loss of the model stagnated after epoch 25, so I stopped there to avoid overfitting. Also, I used a batch size of 5, representing a typical trading week (5 days). I didn't want my batch size to be too small as it may overfit to the noise in the data. Apple stock price can have sudden movements based on earnings or even random movements. Too big a batch size, and the model would fail to learn anything much from the nuances in the data.</p>

            <h3>4. Testing</h2>
            <pre><code>test_data = scaled_data[train_data_len - 60:, :] </code></pre>
            <p><strong>Testing Split:</strong> Gets the data after the training set for testing.</p>
            <pre><code>X_test = []
y_test = adj_close[train_data_len:].values</code></pre>
            <p><strong>X_test, y_test:</strong> These lists will hold the input features and adj close series for the testing data, respectively.</p>
            <pre><code>for i in range(60, len(test_data)):
    X_test.append(test_data[i-60:i, 0])
    
    X_test = np.array(X_test)
    X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1))
</code></pre>
            <p>Similar to what we did in the above sections, just for testing.</p>
            <pre><code>predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)</code></pre>
            <p><strong>predictions:</strong> We use our trained LSTM model to make predictions on the test data. The output is the predicted adjusted closing prices, but they are still in the scaled range (0 to 1). To get the actual predictions back in the original scale, the inverse_transform is applied.</p>

            <h3>5. Visualization</h2>
            <img src="modelprediction3.png" alt="stock price predictions" width="500" height="325">
    <p>
        Finally after all that work, let’s take a look at the results. Our model, trained on Apple stock data, was tasked with predicting future stock prices. The visualization compares the actual stock prices 
        over time with the model's predictions, and overall, it seems like the model performed quite well! When the stock price variance was relatively low, the predictions closely followed the actual values. 
        However, as volatility increased, the model consistently undershot the actual prices.
    </p>
    <p>
        One potential reason for this discrepancy is that the model was trained on data from 1980–2014 but tested on data from 2015–2021. The stock market of the 1980s and early 2000s was vastly different 
        from the market in recent years, both in terms of trading patterns and the scale of Apple’s stock price. Back then, Apple’s stock price was significantly lower, and the company wasn’t the tech giant 
        it is today. These changes in market conditions and price dynamics likely impacted the model’s ability to generalize to more recent data.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the MinMaxScaler helped standardize the data, an alternative scaling method could potentially better account for the shifts in stock price magnitude over time. This is something that would require 
        further testing and fine tuning for me to get right. Additionally, the LSTM model, while effective for time series, might benefit from additional features or external inputs like broader market trends or 
        economic indicators to better handle periods of high volatility. Feeding it indicators like MACD, RSI, and econmics health along with adj close stock price might help it predict the price with better consistency. 
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, the results are pretty promising. THe model captures trends well and could serve as a useful tool for gaining insights into stock price movement. But, like any predictive model in the stock market, 
        it has its limitations. The unpredictability of external events and the constantly evolving market environment are challenges that even the best machine learning models struggle to overcome. Still, this 
        is a solid starting point for building bigger more accurate models.
    </p>
    <p>This could be a useful first tool for beginner investors to use to make informed investment decisions or build upon for their own analysis.</p>

    <section class="section" id="insights">
        <h2>Insights & Conclusions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interconnected Stock Metrics:</strong> The high correlation among stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close) reflects the interconnected nature of daily trading dynamics. 
                This suggests that investors can use one price metric to make inferences about others, which can simplify analysis when making decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Long term Growth Potential:</strong> The finding that daily returns are significantly different from zero implies that Apple’s stock generally follows an upward trajectory 
                over time, confirming what we already suspected. Long term investors have consistently seen positive returns, thanks to Apple’s ability to stay innovative and dominate the tech market. Whether that is the case for the future is the subject of further analysis on more data.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact of External Events:</strong> Big spikes in trading volume tend to coincide with major events like product launches or big market news. Recognizing this pattern can help you anticipate how the stock might move during similar events in the future. Understanding the context behind market behavior is just as important as the numbers themselves. These moments can be a great opportunity to swing trade and make money during the stock's drastic movements. 

</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Predictions: </strong>Using LSTM based models, I was able to pretty acurately predict stock price. Due to the LSTM handling time series data well and Adj. close and time have a strong correlation from which the model can learn. Machine learning is a really useful tool to help understand stocks price movement in the past and also make predictions into the future. However, be cautious as ML models are no magic tool, they can't really predict the future. When it comes to the stock market, its guess may be as good as yours. But that doesn't mean we can try and form an educated guess :)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, whether you’re just starting out in investing or you’re someone with a bit more experience, I hope this analysis helped you learn something new about Apple’s stock and stocks in general. If you’re new to this, the project breaks down some of the more complicated aspects of stock analysis into simpler ideas you can apply elsewhere. And if you already knew a thing or two, I hope you found the statistical insights and machine learning exploration at least a bnit interesting.

At the end of the day, the goal is to get your feet wet with finance and stocks. I know stocks can be intimidating, but the more you break them down and look at them from different angles, the more approachable they become. Hopefully, this analysis has given you some idea how to do tackle analyis whether it’s for Apple, Amazon, or any other stock.</p>
