        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project explores Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data, focusing on key questions regarding stock price behavior, correlations, and market events' impact. The analysis aims to provide insights into the relationships between stock prices, volume, and market trends over time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="data-curation">
        <h2>Data Curation</h2>
        <p>Data was sourced from publicly available historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL).</p>
        <pre><code>file_path = 'AAPL.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)</code></pre>
        <p>After loading the data, preprocessing steps included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Converting dates to datetime objects for temporal analysis.</li>
            <li>Ensuring no missing values in the dataset.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Precheck, no missing values</code></pre>

        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>Key Observations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive Correlation Among Price Metrics:</strong> Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close prices are all very strongly positively correlated. For example, a high opening price generally corresponds to a high closing price, which makes intuitive sense.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak Negative Correlation with Volume:</strong> Prices are weakly negatively correlated with volume, indicating that price movements are not directly tied to trading volume. However, high-volume trading days often accompany significant events, such as earnings announcements or market crashes.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Returns Analysis:</strong> Daily returns show variability around 0, with significant drops during market downturns, such as the dot-com crash.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="analysis">
        <h2>Primary Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Statistical Test on Daily Returns:</strong></p>
        <p>A one-sample t-test was conducted to determine whether the mean daily return is significantly different from zero.</p>
        <p><strong>Hypotheses:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 0 (Mean daily return is equal to zero.)</li>
            <li>H<sub>a</sub>: μ ≠ 0 (Mean daily return is not equal to zero.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Results showed that the p-value was less than 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. This indicates that the mean daily return is significantly different from zero, suggesting consistent stock movement over time. This aligns with Apple stock's historical growth, which has increased tens of thousands of percent since 1980.</p>

            <li>Stock prices are highly correlated, reflecting the interconnected nature of opening, closing, and intraday prices.</li>
            <li>Daily returns are significantly different from zero, implying long-term upward momentum in Apple's stock price.</li>
